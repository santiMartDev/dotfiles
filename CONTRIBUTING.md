# How to contribute



I'm really glad you're reading this, because I need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find me at www.hotpixel.es

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to santiMartDev/dotfiles with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, I will love you forever if you include examples.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

> $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
